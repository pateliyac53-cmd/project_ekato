                    Triple acting mechanical seals feature two seal chambers. They are especially designed for demanding
                    processes requiring a high degree of operational safety. They can be used for extreme pressure
                    applications or for sealing extremely toxic or explosive products.

                <p class="paraghraph-1">
                    The key design feature of single-acting mechanical seals is that they have only two seal rings. This
                    means
                    they have only one interface and no seal liquid chamber. Therefore this type of mechanical seal has
                    to be
                    operated either under dry conditions or it must be lubricated and cooled by the liquid product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key characteristic of single-acting mechanical seals is that they can leak into the surroundings
                    of the
                    vessel. This means the vessel is not technically tight, in contrast to double and triple-acting
                    mechanical
                    seals. Therefore, this seal design is suitable for sealing non critical substances and for low
                    pressure
                    applications.
